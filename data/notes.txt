CS50 UNOFFICIAL SURVIVAL NOTES
A very serious collection of extremely official tips compiled sometime between 2am and 5am during Week 6.

TOPIC: OFFICE HOURS
• Office hours begin promptly at the scheduled time, except when they don’t.
• If the queue says “36 people ahead of you,” that’s normal. Bring a snack.
• The correct answer to “Have you tried rubber duck debugging?” is “Yes,” even if you have not.
• TFs can sense fear. Approach confidently.

TOPIC: DEBUGGING
• 90% of bugs are caused by a missing semicolon you stared directly at for 45 minutes.
• The other 10% are segmentation faults, which means: somewhere, somehow, memory was offended.
• Printing your variables every three lines is not elegant, but it works.
• If something stops working after you fix something else, congratulations: you have unlocked “software engineering.”

TOPIC: PYTHON
• Remember: Python lists begin at index 0. Not 1. Not even if you *really* want them to.
• If your Flask app throws a Jinja error, check your indentation. If it’s not indentation, check your indentation again.
• `print()` is still your friend.

TOPIC: FLASK
• If you see “werkzeug.exceptions.NotFound,” it’s probably your route.
• If you see “KeyError,” it’s probably your form input.
• If nothing works, try turning on `debug=True`. If it still doesn’t work, turn everything off and go for a walk.

TOPIC: SQL
• SELECT * FROM everything WHERE panic = TRUE;
• If your SQL query doesn’t return what you expect, remember: SQLite is not judging you. Yet.
• SQL injection is bad. Prepared statements are good. David would want you to know this.

TOPIC: C
• If you think you understand pointers, you do not.
• If you think you do not understand pointers, you are correct.
• `malloc` gives you power. `free` takes responsibility. Use both wisely.
• BOOM! is the sound of stack overflow. Not the website. The actual stack overflow.

TOPIC: PROBLEM SETS
• Start early. This note will not change your behavior, but it felt important to write.
• The number of hours a pset takes is roughly:
  (percent of assignment completed) * (number of crises experienced) + 4
• Pset parties are for working, but mostly for not working.
• If pset7 makes you question your life choices, that’s completely normal.

TOPIC: COMPUTER SCIENCE WISDOM
• “Why is this happening?” — You, at least once per pset.
• Computers do exactly what you tell them to do, which is unfortunate.
• Reading error messages is a superpower. Acquire it slowly.
• A bug fixed at 3am is not actually fixed. It is lying to you.

TOPIC: HARVARD REALITIES
• Lamont at 1am is a mood. Widener at 9pm is a philosophical crisis.
• Cabot Library has the best chairs. This is objectively true.
• Annenberg breakfast burritos are a force of nature — respect them.

TOPIC: WORKFLOW ADVICE
• Commit often. Commit messages like “fixed stuff” are legally allowed.
• Git merge conflicts build character.
• `pip install` is magic until it isn’t.
• When in doubt, restart VS Code.

TOPIC: LIFE LESSONS
• Take breaks. Seriously.
• Touch grass occasionally. The computer will still be there when you come back.
• CS50 is hard because you’re learning to think differently — but you’re doing great.
• And remember: this is only the beginning. You can build *anything* now.

END OF NOTES (FOR LEGAL REASONS, PROBABLY).
